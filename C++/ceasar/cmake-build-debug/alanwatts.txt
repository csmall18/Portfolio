What this is saying then is, that just as you don't know how
you manage to be conscious, how you manage to grow and 
shape this body of yours, that doesn't mean to say that you're
not doing it. Equally, you don't know how the universe shines the
stars, constellates the constellations, and galactifies
the galaxies - you don't know. But that doesn't mean to
say, that you, aren't doing it in just the same way as
you're breathing without knowing how you breathe.
